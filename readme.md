## Description ##

This plugin adds relational links to various parts of your site.

1. It supports adding rel-syndication/u-syndication links to your posts, indicating where
a syndicated copy is.
2. It adds CSS that will, if the class 'social-icon' is attached to a link in
a list, it will display the appropriate one if available. This allows the setup to be extended very easily. You can use this with a WordPress menu to create some social icons.
**3. Offers two icon sets:** [Genericons](http://genericons.com) or [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/)  
4. Adds an h-card/vcard widget for a specific site author. (Under Development)
5. Allows rel-me links to be placed in the head of the home page or in a widget to support RelMeAuth/IndieAuth

## Future Plans ##

3. Style the h-card/vcard widget with better design and optional rel-me/social icons.

## Installation ##

1. Upload the folder `syndication-links` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
